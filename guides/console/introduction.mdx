# What is the Console?

The Vast console is our web application that is a user interface for using Vast. On it you can search avaliable machines, manage your instances, browse templates, view and edit your account information, purchase credit for using Vast, and much more. Many of this functionality within the console can also be performed with [our CLI commands](https://docs.vast.ai/api/overview-and-quickstart).

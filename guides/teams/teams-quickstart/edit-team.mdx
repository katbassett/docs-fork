### Delete a Team

To delete a team, open the same three-dot menu on the Members page and select 'Delete team'. Make sure you have deleted all instances from the Instances page, or all machines from the Machines page (if you are a host), before proceeding.

âš  Warning: This action is permanent and cannot be undone. All team members will be removed and any remaining credits will be return to your personal account.

<Tip>
Vast.ai operates as a marketplace, connecting users with GPU providers worldwide. This means prices vary based on supply and demand, giving you access to competitive rates for GPU computing.

## How Vast.ai Pricing Works

Unlike traditional cloud providers with fixed pricing, Vast.ai uses a **marketplace model** where hosts set their own prices. This creates competitive rates without static price quotes—the market determines pricing in real-time.

You can easily check current market rates:
- **Web**: [Dashboard](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) shows real-time prices
- **CLI**: Use `vastai search offers` to query prices programmatically (see [CLI Commands](/cli/commands#search-offers))
- **API**: Query programmatically via the [search offers endpoint](/api-reference/introduction)

<Info>
**Serverless Pricing**: Vast Serverless auto-scales instances with no separate pricing tier—you pay only for the underlying instance costs (compute, storage, bandwidth) with no additional fees. See [Serverless Pricing](/documentation/serverless/pricing) for details.

### Key Pricing Principles

- **Market-driven rates**: Prices fluctuate based on real-time supply and demand
- **Combined pricing**: Your total cost includes a combination of GPU compute, storage, and bandwidth charges
- **Pay for what you use**: Billed by the second for actual usage
- **Service level pricing**: Costs vary based on dedicated or interruptible access and term length

## What does Vast cost compared to other providers?

Vast typically delivers more competitive pricing than traditional cloud providers. The marketplace model creates natural price competition—hosts compete for your business rather than locking you into fixed rates.

Key advantages:
- Direct competition between hosts drives rates lower
- Real-time supply and demand optimizes pricing
- No markup layered on top of host-set prices
- Global GPU supply improves availability and cost

## Cost Components

Your total rental cost includes three primary components:

### GPU Compute
Charged per second while your instance is running. Rates vary significantly based on:
- **GPU model**: High-end models (H100, A100) command premium rates
- **GPU quantity**: Multi-GPU configurations increase costs proportionally
- **Host reliability**: Higher reliability scores typically correlate with higher prices
- **Geographic location**: Regional supply and demand affects pricing
- **Market conditions**: Real-time marketplace dynamics influence rates

### Storage
Billed continuously while your instance exists, regardless of running state. Storage costs vary by host and are typically higher for stopped instances than running instances.

<Warning>
Storage charges continue even when instances are stopped. Delete instances completely to cease storage billing.
</Warning>

### Bandwidth
Data transfer costs vary by host and include both upload and download traffic. Charges apply per byte transferred. Review bandwidth rates during instance selection as these can significantly impact total costs for data-intensive workloads.

## Instance Types & Pricing

Vast.ai offers three instance types with different pricing models:

- **On-demand**: Fixed pricing, guaranteed resources (high priority)
- **Reserved**: Discounted rates with pre-payment (high priority)
- **Interruptible**: Lowest cost, may be paused (low priority)

Pricing varies by instance type, with interruptible instances often 50%+ cheaper than on-demand, and reserved instances offering up to 50% discount with commitment.

For detailed information about each instance type and when to use them, see [Instance Types](/documentation/instances/instance-types).

## Common Pricing Questions

### How do I find the cheapest GPUs?

Use the search filters on the [Dashboard](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) to sort by price. Consider:
- Interruptible instances for non-critical workloads (often 50%+ cheaper)
- Lower reliability scores (may offer better rates)
- Different geographic regions

### Can I get a discount for long-term use?

Yes! Convert any on-demand instance to reserved pricing for up to 50% off. See [Reserved Instances](/documentation/instances/reserved-instances) for details.

### Why do prices vary so much?

Vast.ai is a marketplace where hosts set their own prices based on:
- Supply and demand in their region
- Their operating costs
- Machine specifications and reliability
- Competition from other hosts

## Billing Basics

Here are the essential billing concepts to understand:

- **Credits required upfront**: You must add credits to your account before starting any instances
- **Automatic instance suspension**: When your credit balance reaches zero, instances are automatically stopped but remain in your account
- **Ongoing storage charges**: You continue to be billed for storage on stopped instances until they are deleted

For complete billing details, see the [billing page](/documentation/reference/billing).

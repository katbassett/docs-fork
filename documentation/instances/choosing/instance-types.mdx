description: Understand Vast.ai instance types - On-demand, Reserved, and Interruptible. Learn how each type works, their differences, and when to use each.
---

Vast.ai offers three instance types with different priority levels and pricing models to match your workload requirements and budget.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="On-demand" icon="shield-check">
**High Priority**
Fixed pricing, guaranteed resources
</Card>

<Card title="Reserved" icon="piggy-bank">
**High Priority**
Discounted rates with pre-payment
</Card>

<Card title="Interruptible" icon="shuffle">
**Low Priority**
Lowest cost, may be paused
</Card>
</CardGroup>

In the create interface, you'll see a selector for "on-demand" or "interruptible". Once an instance is rented, you cannot change its type. However, you can convert on-demand instances to reserved for discounts.

## On-demand Instances

**Best for**: Production workloads, continuous training, time-sensitive tasks

On-demand instances provide:
- **Exclusive GPU control** with high priority
- **Guaranteed resources** for the contract duration
- **Fixed pricing** set by the host
- **Maximum duration** shown on offer cards
- **Data persistence** even when stopped

### Key Considerations
- Check the maximum duration before renting (shown on offer cards)
- For long-running jobs (days/weeks), verify host reliability scores
- When contracts expire, hosts may renew or stop the instance
- Data remains accessible when instances are stopped

<Warning>
**Expired Instance Deletion**: Expired instances may be deleted 48 hours after expiration. Retrieve your data before then. Expired instances cannot restart while expired.
</Warning>

## Reserved Instances

**Best for**: Long-term projects, predictable workloads, cost optimization

Reserved instances are on-demand instances with pre-paid discounts:
- **Up to 50% discount** based on commitment length
- **Same high priority** as on-demand
- **Convert anytime** from existing on-demand instances
- **Credits locked** to the specific instance
- **Partial refunds** available if cancelled early

To create a reserved instance, first rent on-demand, then convert using the discount badge on your instance card.

For detailed instructions on creating and managing reserved instances, see [Reserved Instances](/documentation/instances/choosing/reserved-instances).
</Info>

## Interruptible Instances

**Best for**: Batch processing, fault-tolerant workloads, development/testing

Interruptible instances use a bidding system:
- **Lowest cost** (often 50%+ cheaper than on-demand)
- **Bidding priority** - higher bids get priority
- **May be paused** if outbid or if on-demand requested
- **Data preserved** when paused but instance not functional
- **Resume automatically** when priority returns

### Working with Interruptible Instances

<Warning>
When using interruptible instances:
- **Save work frequently** to disk
- **Use cloud storage** for important outputs
- **Implement checkpointing** in your code
- **Expect interruptions** and plan accordingly
</Warning>

Priority rules:
1. On-demand instances always have highest priority
2. Among interruptible instances, highest bid wins
3. Paused instances resume when they regain priority

## Choosing the Right Type

| Use Case | Recommended Type | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Production inference | On-demand | Need guaranteed availability |
| Multi-day training | Reserved | Long-term discount with reliability |
| Hyperparameter search | Interruptible | Can handle interruptions, cost matters |
| Data preprocessing | Interruptible | Can resume where left off |
| Time-critical jobs | On-demand | Cannot afford interruptions |
| Development/testing | Interruptible | Short sessions, cost-sensitive |
| Steady workloads | Reserved | Predictable usage, want discounts |

## Quick Reference

### Switching Between Types
- **On-demand → Reserved**: ✅ Yes, anytime via discount badge
- **On-demand → Interruptible**: ❌ No, must create new instance
- **Interruptible → On-demand**: ❌ No, must create new instance
- **Reserved → On-demand**: ⚠️ Lose remaining discount

### Priority Levels
1. **On-demand/Reserved**: High priority, never interrupted
2. **Interruptible (high bid)**: Runs when resources available
3. **Interruptible (low bid)**: Paused until higher bids complete

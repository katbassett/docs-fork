title: Choosing a Template
description: Select the right template for your Vast.ai instance. Templates define your Docker image, launch mode, and initialization settings.

## What are Templates?

Templates are saved configurations that define how your instance will be set up. Every instance on Vast.ai requires a template that specifies:

- **Docker image** - The base container environment
- **Launch mode** - How you'll connect (SSH, Jupyter, or Entrypoint)
- **Initialization** - Startup scripts and environment variables
- **Ports and networking** - Required network configurations

<Note>
For comprehensive template documentation including creating custom templates, see the main [Templates section](/documentation/templates/introduction).
</Note>

## Selecting a Template

When renting an instance, you must select a template first. You have three options:

### 1. Recommended Templates
Pre-configured templates for common use cases:
- **PyTorch** - Ready for deep learning with Jupyter
- **TensorFlow** - ML development environment
- **Stable Diffusion** - Image generation UIs
- **LLM Inference** - Text generation setups
- **Base Ubuntu** - Clean development environment

### 2. Your Recent Templates
Templates you've previously used or customized are saved for quick access.

### 3. Custom Templates
Create your own or modify existing templates to match your exact needs.

## Quick Template Selection

1. On the [search page](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/), look for the template selector in the upper left
2. Click "Change Template" to see available options
3. Select a template that matches your needs
4. The search will update to show compatible machines

<Tip>
Start with a recommended template and modify it rather than creating from scratch. This ensures compatibility and faster startup times.
</Tip>

## Launch Modes

Templates support three connection methods:

### SSH
- Terminal access via SSH
- Best for: Development, training scripts, command-line work
- Includes tmux session management

### Jupyter
- Web-based notebook interface
- Best for: Data science, experimentation, visualization
- Includes terminal access

### Entrypoint
- Runs Docker's native entrypoint
- Best for: Automated workloads, API servers, production deployments
- No automatic SSH/Jupyter setup

## Important Template Settings

### Docker Image
- Always specify a version tag (avoid "latest")
- Vast.ai base images (`vastai/pytorch`) start faster due to caching
- Custom images from Docker Hub supported

### On-start Script
- Runs after the container starts
- Use for installing additional packages
- Executes as bash commands

### Disk Space
- Set in the search interface (not the template)
- Cannot be changed after instance creation
- Default is 10GB - increase as needed

## Common Issues

### Template Compatibility
Not all templates work on all machines. If an instance fails to start:
- Try a recommended template
- Check Docker image availability
- Verify port requirements match machine capabilities

### Invalid Docker Image Path
If you get an error like "Unable to find image 'ubuntu20.04_latest/ssh'":
- You have an invalid Docker image path
- Use proper format: `nvidia/cuda:12.0.1-devel-ubuntu20.04`
- Always include repository and tag
- Test locally: `docker pull <YOUR_IMAGE_PATH>`
- Use recommended templates to ensure valid paths

### Image Loading Time
- First launch can take 5-60 minutes depending on image size
- Vast.ai base images load faster (pre-cached on many machines)
- You're not charged during loading

### Can't Change Template on Existing Instance
Templates are recipes for new instances. Once an instance is created:
- Template changes only affect new instances
- To use a different template, create a new instance
- Transfer data if needed using [data movement tools](/documentation/instances/storage/data-movement)

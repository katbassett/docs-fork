description: Save up to 50% on GPU costs by pre-paying for reserved instances. Learn how to convert on-demand instances to reserved pricing.
---

Reserved instances allow you to get significant discounts (up to 50%) by pre-paying for GPU time. You can convert any on-demand instance to a reserved instance at any time.

## How Reserved Instances Work

You can **convert an on-demand instance into a reserved instance** with a lower hourly rate by pre-paying.

**Key points:**
- Convert any on-demand instance to reserved pricing
- Discounts up to 50% based on commitment length
- Pre-paid credits are locked to that specific instance
- Cannot migrate between hosts

## Creating a Reserved Instance

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web UI">
    **Step 1 — Rent the Instance**

    1. Go to [Search](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) page.
    2. Find a GPU that meets your requirements, click the **Rent** button.
    3. This creates an **on-demand instance**.

    **Step 2 — Convert to a Reserved Instance**

    1. Go to the [**Instances**](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/) page.
    2. On your instance card, find the **green** **discount badge**.

       <Frame caption="Save badge">
       ![Save badge](/images/instances-reserved.webp)
       </Frame>

    3. Click the badge — a new window will open with the **available pre-paid periods** (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, 6 months).

       <Frame caption="Add Reserved Discount">
       ![Reserved Discount](/images/instances-reserved-2.webp)
       </Frame>

    4. Select your preferred period and confirm. The system calculates deposit and discount automatically.

    Your instance is now reserved at the discounted rate. When an instance is converted to a reserved instance, you will see **Saved %** badge on the instance card to indicate the reserved discount is active.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    1. **Add credits** to your account (if needed).
    2. Create an instance, get the instance id. CLI:`vastai show instances`
    3. Run the following command, where:
       **ID** is the id of instance to prepay for
       **AMOUNT** is amount of instance credit prepayment (default discount func of 0.2 for 1 month, 0.3 for 3 months)

      ```cli CLI
      vastai prepay instance ID AMOUNT
      ```

    An example:

      ```cli CLI
      vastai prepay instance 24973511 50
      prepaid for 0.546 months of instance 24973511 applying $50.0 credits for a discount of 3.5000000000000004%
      ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Important Considerations

- If you later change your mind, you can withdrawal only any fraction of the funds that remain after paying the difference between the on demand and discounted price over the current duration.
- If the machine fails the implicit or explicit Service Level Agreement and is deverified the full balance can be withdrawn without penalty.
- Reserved instances cannot migrate between different hosts.

<Warning>
**Important:**
Every time you add credits, your discount is recalculated. Avoid adding small amounts mid-term — you could end up with a worse rate. For example: If you have a 3-month reservation and add 2 weeks of credit with only 2 weeks left, your discount could drop.
</Warning>

## Extending a Reserved Instance

You can extend your reservation at any time:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web UI">
    Same flow as above - via **Save** badge on instance card.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    More flexibility — deposit any amount you choose. For example:

    ```bash Bash
    vastai prepay instance 24973511 50
    prepaid for 0.546 months of instance 24973511 applying $50.0 credits for a discount of 3.5000000000000004%
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Refunds

You can cancel (destroy) a reserved / prepaid instance to get part of your deposit back.
Refund = Remaining deposit **minus** total discount already received.

**Example:**
- On-demand: $1/hr → $720/month
- Reserved (1 month): $576/month
- Cancel immediately → Refund = $576
- Cancel after 15 days → Remaining = $288 → Refund = $216 (after discount penalty)
- Cancel at the end → Refund = $0

You will see the refund on the Billing page -> Invoices table.

## Common Questions

### Can I switch an existing on-demand instance to reserved?

Yes, if there is an available discount. Go to the **Instances** page, click the **discount badge** on your instance card, choose a period, and confirm.

### Can I extend a reserved instance?

Yes — you can extend it anytime via the same discount badge in the Instances page, as long as the instance still has an active discount period. You can use the CLI for custom amounts.

### What happens if I cancel / delete a reserved instance early?

You'll receive a partial refund of your unused pre-paid balance, minus the total discount received so far. You will see the refund on Billing page.

### What happens if I stop a reserved instance?

If you stop the instance, the GPU will be released like any other instance and may be rented by another user.

## What is a Template?

A template is how Vast helps you launch an instance, setting up your rented machine with whatever software and formatting you need. Templates are generally used for launching instances through the web interface, but they can also be used in the CLI or through the API.  In this document, we will focus on the web interface, but we will link to other relevant documentation throughout.

In the simplest technical terms, you can consider a template to be a wrapper around `docker run`. The template contains all of the information you want to pass to our systems to configure the environment.

You can browse the template section of the web interface at [cloud.vast.ai/templates](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/)

## Recommended Templates

We provide several recommended templates to help you get started.  These are pre-configured environments that you can use as-is, or you can tweak them to your own requirements. &#x20;

<Note>
  It's a great idea to look at how these templates have been configured to guide you in creating your own.
</Note>

Find out more about our recommended templates in the [Vast-Specific Features](/documentation/templates/creating-templates#vast-specific-features) section.

## Quick Start

To jump right in and run a template, follow these steps

Visit the templates section of the console where you will find all of our recommended templates.

</Frame>

Browse through the templates until you find one that meets your requirements.  In this guide we will use NVIDIA CUDA, which is the first on the list. It's a great starter template as it just includes the CUDA development environment, plus a few extras to improve the user experience.

Now, click the 'play' button.  This will load the template and take you to the available offers

<Frame caption="Offers page with GPU filter active">

</Frame>

There are filters available at the top of the page to help you target a particular GPU.  You will also find many additional filters on the left of the page for more fine-grained control over the instances you find.

When you have found a suitable offer, simply click the 'RENT' button to create your new instance.

You can now visit [cloud.vast.ai/instances](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/) where you will find your running instance.  It may take a few minutes to be ready as everything is being set up.

</Frame>

When it is ready you will see the blue open button.  This indicates that the instance is ready to connect.

<Note>
  The action of the open button depends on the template you have chosen - In this example you will be transferred to the [Instance Portal](https://docs.vast.ai/instance-portal).  You can learn how to configure this in our [Creating Templates](/documentation/templates/creating-templates) guide.

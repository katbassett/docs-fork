Vast.ai now offers full virtual machines (VMs) in addition to Docker-based instance rentals.

# Feature Comparison

VMs offer the following features not available in Docker:

- Support for init managers (e.g., `systemd`). This is necessary for running Docker, Kubernetes, Snap, or other containerization-based applications within an instance.
- Support for process tracing (`ptrace`).

VMs have the following drawbacks compared to Docker-based instances:

- Slower creation and boot times
- Higher disk overhead
- Smaller selection of machines
- Lesser availability of preconfigured templates
- Only SSH launch mode currently supported

# Creating a VM

First, make sure that you have added your SSH keys to your account page first (see [ssh guide](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/sshscp)), as SSH keys cannot be edited on running VMs. SSH access is currently the only method preconfigured on VM instances.

Use one of the below templates; the template will automatically filter for machines that support VMs and will launch a VM when you rent with that template:

# VM Template Customization

VM images are packaged in docker images from the `docker.io/vastai/kvm` repository. VM templates must use one of these docker images.

>

VM images must be specified using the *fully qualified* server/organization/repo name.

## Docker options

VM templates support the following flags in the "Docker options" field. These will have the same effect as in docker-based instances.

- **environment variables**: "-e JUPYTER\_DIR=/ -e TEST=OK"
  - Environment variables will be written to :::iframe\{code=""}
- **ports**: "-p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082/udp -p 70000:70000"

For more details on these options, see [environment](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/docker-execution-environment).

## Launch modes

Currently only SSH is supported.

## On start script

The On-start script field allows specifying a script to run on instance start. Unlike in docker-based instances, the interpreter must be specified by a shebang (e.g. :::iframe\{code=""}

<Iframe code="<code>">

</Iframe>

\::: #!/bin/bash   for bash.)

# Other differences from Docker-based instances

- Currently, the cloud copy utility for VMs only allows *migrating* the entire VM, instead of allowing individual folders to be copied.
- Copy is only supported between two VMs, not between VMs and external cloud storage providers.
- The copy utility for VMs is invoked by `vastai vm copy $SRC $DEST`.
